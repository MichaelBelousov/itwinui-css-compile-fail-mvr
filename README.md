# made with create-react-app

to reproduce just start the project:

```sh
yarn start
```

## creation

this mvr was created by starting a react project, adding the `sass` and `@itwin/itwinui-css` dependencies
and then importing and using the themed mixin on the app component so itwinui-css isn't tree shaken.
